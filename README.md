# Project

Use Github as a CDN source to pull static JS.

## JsDelivr

We can natively use JsDelivr to automatically load any github repo as a CDN

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thibautSchmutz/cdn-assets@1.0.0/dist/coucou.js"></script>
```

Note: Good practice to tag each release.
